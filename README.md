# Optimal-test-kit-based-strategy
Codes used in our paper optimal test-kit based intervention strategy of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous complex networks are stored here.One scale-free network adjacency matrix is given albert-barabasi graph of node N=500 with average node-degree 14.First code Network_Imax is used to generate fig (6.a) ,(6.b) and (6.c) by changing percentage of node value and taking different strategy.Second code  Network_Zfos is used to generate fig (6.d) ,(6.e) and (6.f) by changing percentage of node value and taking different strategy.Third code Network_average_degree_Imax_zfos is used to generate fig (4.c)and (4.d).Last code is used to show the status of cumulative infection time series for different testing-kit strategies.
